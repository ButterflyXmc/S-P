    <h2>Spongebob: What do you usually do when I'm gone? 
        <br>
        Patrick: Wait for you to come back</h2>
<p>Well there it is, that's Spongebob and Patricks's friendship for you. Spongebob and
    Patrick are bestfriends but more like brothers.<br> Their relationship is what I believe
    all the bestfriends out there should strive for. They always support each other's ideas,<br>
    they enjoy each other's presence. I adore their friendship, even if its fictional.
